### Responsibility and Role of the IT Program 

#### The IT Program determines and conceptually plans the best ways for technology to meet the goals of the program and the Trek Tech Corporation. The IT Program will install, maintain, and upgrade systems as necessary. The IT Program will be responsible for researching and developing new ways to accomplish tasks in a productive and timely manner. The IT Programâ€™s ability to properly support new devices and applications often require additional resources that may take time to acquire and install. The IT Program will balance the load of services across resources as necessary. By including the IT Program in preliminary discussions, programs can start preparations to support and keep projects flowing smoothly.
